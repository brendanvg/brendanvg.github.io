												<img src="images/board_retreat.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="214" align="right" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="7"><span class="maintext">Research shows that directors in today&rsquo;s boardroom do not have the time or available commitment to do as much they would like for the corporations they serve. David Lesser and Associates specialize in bringing the skills, insight and energy to the board of directors that will make new possibilities available for your business or non-profit organization.<br><br>
												Independent directors are often full time executives in other businesses chosen for what their name may bring. Their limited time gets absorbed in the recent emphasis on the requirement to police management. The most effective corporations today are finding tremendous value in appointing professional directors whose talent is to make the boardroom fertile with creativity; not merely to police but to help pilot the corporation into being everything it can be.</span><br><br>
												<div align="center">
													<a href="consult.html"><img src="images/personal_call.gif" alt="" width="376" height="66" border="0"></a></div>
												<br>
												<h2><img src="images/creativity.gif" alt="" width="248" height="26" border="0"></h2>
												<span class="maintext">As with individual lives, corporations typically reach a point that requires their capacity and competence to grow beyond what used to work so well in bringing us thus far. Crucial transition is too big to do alone. An effective board of directors will function as coach and confidant giving the CEO and senior management the message: &ldquo;Go for it. We&rsquo;re with you.&rdquo;<br>
													<br>
													So often, however, precious board time is bogged down in considerations which, at best, have little impact on success. At worst, boardroom dynamics have the unintended effect of putting the CEO and his or her team on the defensive. When  independent directors become cautious in their contributions we have a board that does not make the difference that it could. For all their brilliance as executives in other fields, few board members know how to turn these dynamics around and establish the top level of the corporation as a field of immense creativity.<br>
													<br>
														David Lesser and his team can make that happen for you.</span><br>
