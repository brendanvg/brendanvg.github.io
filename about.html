          <h3>Ever wanted to do your own Jewish thing?</h3>
          <h6>Like host a low-key Shabbat dinner for friends? Or throw a Hannukah party and serve latkes, fried chicken, and cold beer? Or have a few folks over for Sunday brunch where everyone tells a story of Birthright love and adventure? </h6>
        </div>

        <div class="panel" id="aboutpanel2">
          <p>Well now’s the time to go for it. And JThing’s here to help you make it happen. JThing is a new initiative for Penn alumni that will give you the funds and the support you need to do your own Jewish thing. All you need is a bunch friends and a little chutzpah.
<br>
<br>

JThing’s staff of creative rabbis and program innovators is here for you. Whether you want to bounce some ideas off of them or if you just need someone to say, “Yeah! Do it!” JThing’s got you covered. JThing is a project of Penn Hillel. It’s an experiment to see if Penn Hillel can make a Jewish difference in the lives of recent grads – even if they’ve ended up far from Philly. Even if all their friends didn’t go to Penn.
<br>
<br>
So, want to do this? Got an idea? Get started by letting us know what you’re thinking. Someone will get back to you ASAP and you can go from there. Are you like, “Yeah, this would be awesome” but not sure what your JThing is just yet? Start by checking out our four JThing Starter Kits – complete with “how to” checklists. Just click on a picture on the <a href=dinner.html> ideas page</a>. Choose the party you want to throw, and then be in touch. </p>
