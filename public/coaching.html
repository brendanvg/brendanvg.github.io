			<h2 class="subheader">Whole Being Coaching</h2>
				
			<p class="maintext">High achievers typically reach a point where a deeper range of inner strength is asked for. Short-term fixes address only a part of the wholeness of who we are, which is why their effects are limited. David Lesser and Associates whole being coaching integrates business life, spiritual life, relationships and wellness.
			<br>
			<br>
			When our achieving is aligned with our sense of destiny, remarkable creativity is unleashed. Whole being coaching brings together the basic tools of leadership development, emotional dynamics, spiritual practice and body-energy work in ways that will be uniquely appropriate for you and your situation. Together we will walk the path to that potent alignment.</p>

			<h2 class="subheader">Crucial Transitions</h2>
			
			<p class="maintext">The force of destiny brings each of us into situations that require our capacity and competence to grow beyond what used to work so well for us thus far. The way to expand involves going through these crucial transitions.
			<br>
			<br>
			Some back away preferring to stay with the familiar. The brave go onward to levels yet uncharted.
			<br>
			For practically everyone, these crucial transitions are too big to do alone. You are not meant to walk through by yourself. Our coaching system is designed to give you the close-in support and guidance you need to change and grow. We do not work on an hourly rate as some coaches do. Under our standard arrangement, you will meet with your coach once a week by phone or in person and have access to us during points of crisis and breakthrough as much as you need.
			<br>
			We say "Go for it. I'm with you"</p>
